# P2SIF: Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Driving
This is the codebase for my ECE 257B project.

Please follow the below steps:
- Go to `kubernetes` directory for instructions on how to run the pipelines for data-collection in CARLA simulator.
- Go to `data-collection` directory to see how the autopilot, caption generation and radar data generation is implemented in python.
- Go to `lidar-radar-clip` directory to see how LiDAR and Radar based CLIP models are trained.

Look at [Final Project Report](https://github.com/ece257b/Sensor-Fusion-for-Autonomous-Driving/blob/main/Final_Project_Report.pdf) for more details.
